--------------------
Polymorphism
--------------------
1. Compile Time
2. Run Time
--------------------

Note : Deciding which version of overloaded function/operator/or else to call is called Binding.

=> Compile Time polymorphism
a) Function Overloading
b) Operator Overloading

How Compile time?
The function calls are resolved at compile time
(also called Early Binding)

----------------------

When compiler is not able to decide which one function to call (probably because of call depends on user input), 
it postpones the decision til runtime.

Run time Polymorphism also called Late Binding (binding done at run-time)
