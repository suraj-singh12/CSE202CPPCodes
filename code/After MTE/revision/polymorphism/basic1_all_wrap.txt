Upcasted pointer:
--------------------------------------------
Derived d;
Base *b = &d;   // b is an upcasted pointer 
--------------------------------------------

Abstract Class:
--------------------------------------------
->Contains 'atleast' one pure virtual function
->'May' contain non-virtual functions
->Object creation not possible
--------------------------------------------


1. A virtual function is 'early binded' "if called through it's own class's object"

2. A virtual function is 'late binded' "if called through pointer" (upcasted or not doesn't matter)        [as shown in all examples, the draw() fn was called by using upcasted pointer, so it was late binded]


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An empty class appears empty but is not empty
It has 4 member functions automatically present in it
1. zero argument constructor
2. destructor
3. copy constructor
4. overloaded assignment

eg. 
class Student{

};
// This class has all those 4 member functions
